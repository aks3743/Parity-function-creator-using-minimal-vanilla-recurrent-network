# Parity-function-creator-using-minimal-vanilla-recurrent-network


Let us define a sequence parity function as a function that takes in a sequence of binary inputs and returns a sequence indicating the number of 0’s in the input so far; specifically, if at time t the 0’s in the input so far is even it returns 1, and 0 if it is odd. For example, given input sequence [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], the parity sequence is [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. 

 

Implement the minimal vanilla recurrent neural network to learn the parity function. Explain your rationale using a state transition diagram and parameters of the network.
